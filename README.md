# deblur-LGP
Code to implement blind deblurring algorithm using local gradient product prior.
Wait for completely submission. 
Repository established on September 4, 2023.

Within our repository, you will find several important files:

1. **voc_distri.m**
   - This file corresponds to Fig. 3 in our paper.
   - To use this file, please download the VOC2012 dataset from the following link: [VOC2012 Dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/#devkit).

2. **grad_product.m**
   - This script takes the gradient map of an image as input and generates the local gradient product map of the image as output.

3. **LGP_comp.m**
   - In this file, we illustrate the differences between clear images and blurred images, including Fig. 1 in our work.

4. **im01_ker08.mat**
   - A image file in the Levin et al. dataset. (Understanding and evaluating blind deconvolution algorithms) 

Our research work has been submitted to ICASSP 2024. We are committed to making our complete code available as soon as our article is accepted by ICASSP(hope it's good enough).
If our submission is not accepted, the complete code will remain in a "coming soon" status. :P @_@
