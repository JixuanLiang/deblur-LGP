# deblur-LGP
Code to implement blind deblurring algorithm using local gradient product prior.
Wait for completely submission. 
Repository established on September 4, 2023.

There are servel files in our works:

voc_distri.m \
This file corresponds Fig. 3 in our paper. 
Download VOC2012 dataset: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/#devkit

grad_product.m \
input is gradient map of a image, and output is local gradient product map of the image.

LGP_comp.m \
In this file, we demonstrate the difference between clear images and blurred images. (Fig. 1)

Our research work has been submitted to ICASSP 2024. We are committed to making our complete code available as soon as our article is accepted by ICASSP(hope it's good enough).
If our submission is not accepted, the code will remain in a "coming soon" status. :P @_@
